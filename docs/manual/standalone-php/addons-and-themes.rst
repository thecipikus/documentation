What are Add-Ons & Themes?
---------------------------

TubePress "add-ons" are small software packages that add or change the default functionality of TubePress.
TubePress "themes" are template sets that can change the layout and/or appearance of TubePress.

The central source for all TubePress add-ons and themes is the `TubePress Marketplace`_. There you can browse
and download add-ons and themes developed by both TubePress LLC as well as community contributions.

TubePress Content Directory
---------------------------

Both add-ons and themes are stored in the "TubePress Content Directory", which is a special directory inside
your TubePress installation located at ``tubepress_pro_x_y_z/tubepress-content``.
