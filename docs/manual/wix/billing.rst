Billing
=======

TubePress is available to all Wix.com users for a free 30-day trial. To continue using the
service beyond the trial period, we charge a small monthly fee. Wix provides
`detailed instructions <http://www.wix.com/support/main/html5/wix-app-market/adding-apps-wix-app-market#Upgrading+Your+App>`_
on how to pay for TubePress.

.. _wix-billing-how-many-times:

How many sites can I use TubePress on?
**************************************

Wix bills on a per-site basis. For instance if you have two Wix.com websites that are both using TubePress, you will be
billed twice: once for each website.

However, there is no limit to the number of times that you may add TubePress to any website. Even if you use TubePress
in twenty different places on your site, you will still just be billed once.

.. _wix-billing-how-to-transfer:

I started a new website. How do I transfer my TubePress purchase?
*****************************************************************

Since Wix handles billing on our behalf, you will need to `contact Wix <http://www.wix.com/about/contact-us>`_ to
transfer your upgraded apps to your new site.

.. _wix-billing-miss-payment:

What happens if I miss a payment?
*********************************

If your trial period ends before payment, or if you miss a payment, TubePress will simply "go dark" on your website and
your site visitors will see an empty box where TubePress used to be. You may continue to access the TubePress settings
from within the site editor.

After Wix receives payment, TubePress will pick up right where you left off. You won't lose anything.
