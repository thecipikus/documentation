Using TubePress in Wix.com
==========================

This page details how to use TubePress for Wix. It assumes that you already have a
Wix website up and running; if not, Wix offers `excellent documentation to get you started <http://www.wix.com/support/main/html5/getting-started>`_.

Adding the TubePress App
------------------------

TubePress is available to Wix.com as an "app" in the `Wix App Market <http://www.wix.com/blog/2012/10/introducing-the-wix-app-market/>`_.
As such, Wix provides `detailed documentation on how to use the App Market <http://www.wix.com/support/main/html5/wix-app-market/adding-apps-wix-app-market>`_.

For the sake of completeness, here's how to add TubePress to your site.

 1. Inside the Wix Editor, click the App Market button.

    like any other Wix element.

Configuring - Simple

    "App Settings".

 2. A small window will popup which contains some simple settings for TubePress. Feel free to click around and
    change some of the options. Your changes will be reflected "live" so that you can see the result immediately.

Configuring - Full Settings
---------------------------

In the previous section you learned how to access a few settings for your TubePress instance. However, **the options
found in the small popup window are actually a small fraction of the options available to you.** We simply "hide" them
so as to not overwhelm new users.

Here's how to access the rest of the settings:

 1. In the basic TubePress settings window, click the "More Settings" button.

 2. A new window will open which contains *all* of the TubePress settings. Feel free change any setting you like, and
    click the "Save" button once you're done.
