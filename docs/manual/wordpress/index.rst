TubePress for WordPress
=======================

TubePress is available to use as a WordPress plugin, which makes it a breeze to use on
any WordPress site.

While the WordPress plugin is available 100% for free, we recommend the premium version of the plugin: TubePress Pro.
TubePress Pro includes all the features of the free TubePress plugin, plus the following additional capabilities:

 * Priority technical support (i.e. you jump to the front of the line)
 * Use in WordPress templates (outside post or page content)
 * Multiple video sources in a single, unified gallery (e.g. YouTube + Vimeo in the same gallery)
 * Auto-next playback (when a video ends, start playback of the next video in the gallery)
 * Full HTTPS capability
 * Extended controls for the YouTube video player
 * Highest-resolution thumbnails from YouTube and Vimeo
 * Asynchronous paging through gallery pages (video playback does not stop)
 * Asynchronous interactive video search
 * Play videos with Fancybox or Tinybox
