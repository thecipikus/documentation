Using Add-Ons & Themes
======================

Much like WordPress itself, TubePress can be infinitely customized by add-ons and themes.

.. note:: *TubePress* add-ons and themes should not be confused with *WordPress* plugins and themes.
          While conceptually similar, the two are not interchangeable.

The central source for all TubePress add-ons and themes is the `TubePress Marketplace`_. There you can browse
and download add-ons and themes developed by both TubePress LLC as well as community contributions.

TubePress Content Directory
---------------------------

Both add-ons and themes are stored in a the "TubePress content directory", which is a special directory inside
your WordPress installation located at ``wp-content/tubepress-content``.
