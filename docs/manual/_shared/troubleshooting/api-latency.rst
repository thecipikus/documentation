What you see on youtube.com or vimeo.com will not be immediately and exactly identical to what's available to TubePress.
There is often a caching delay before videos are available over the API (which TubePress uses). It's almost always less
than an hour, but has been know to take up to an entire day. The punchline here is: **it can take up to a day for your
gallery to sync up to the video provider.**

Please read `YouTube's explanation <http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/reference.html#Overview>`_ for more
details regarding the API delay for YouTube.
