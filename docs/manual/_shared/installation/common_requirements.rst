It's a good idea to first make sure that your web server meets the minimum requirements to run
TubePress. You will need:

 * PHP 5.2 or higher
 * `PHP DOM extension`_ (enabled by default in PHP, only required for
   using TubePress with YouTube)
 * `PHP PCRE extension`_ built with PCRE version 7.1 or
   higher (enabled in most PHP installations)
