TubePress can use `JW Player <http://www.jwplayer.com/>`_ 5.10 to play YouTube videos. We are working to
integrate JW Player 6.x, but this feature is not yet ready for production.

 1. Download the file ``player.swf`` from `here <http://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/browser/tags/mediaplayer-5.10/player.swf>`_.

 2. Upload the file to your TubePress Pro installation at

    ``<tubepress_home>/src/main/web/flash/longtail/player.swf``.
