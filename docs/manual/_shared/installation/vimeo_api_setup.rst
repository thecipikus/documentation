In order to use TubePress with Vimeo, you are required to obtain a "consumer key" and "consumer secret"
from Vimeo. This is a one-time setup required by Vimeo. If you'd like the gory details behind the reasons
for this, please read this blog post. Thankfully it's easy to create these credentials and supply them to
TubePress.

 1. `Log in to Vimeo <http://vimeo.com/log_in>`_, if you haven't already.
 2. `Click here <https://developer.vimeo.com/apps/new>`_ to create a new Vimeo app. You can fill in anything
    for the fields. Below is a sample form that's filled out. Then click the `Create App` button.

 3. Make a note of the "Client ID" and "Client secret" of your new app. See the red box below for an idea
    of what it should look like.
