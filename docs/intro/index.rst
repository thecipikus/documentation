How to Get TubePress
--------------------
There are two independent installation paths for TubePress:

 1. One of two **downloadable** software packages:

   * Free WordPress Plugin
   * TubePress Pro (for WordPress and/or any PHP site)

 2. One of two **cloud-hosted** TubePress installations:

   * `TubePress Express <http://express.tubepress.com/>`_
   * `Wix App Market <http://www.wix.com/about/app-market#!app-market/cbqa/apps/tubepress/overview>`_

Either installation path provides nearly identical features, but there are a number of drawbacks and
advantages to each:
