Welcome to TubePress
====================

TubePress adds dynamic and interactive video features to websites. It's highly configurable and designed for website
builders and users of any skill level. A typical use of TubePress is to :doc:`embed a video gallery <intro/feature/galleries>`
into a web page.

TubePress is available both as a downloadable package and via several cloud-hosted, zero-installation
services. The software is largely open sourced, and it's designed and maintained by `TubePress LLC`_, a software company
based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
